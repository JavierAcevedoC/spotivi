# Spotivi

## An spotibar plugin added as [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/) layer

## Important!
This project is basically a wrapper so, you need install and configure [ spotibar ](https://github.com/conor-f/spotibar) follow the instructions.

Install [vim-proc](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim) and remember use neovim python integration.
```sh
    pip install neovim
```

The issue on v1.8-dev to mapping the [SPC] is solved with:

```sh
    rm -rf $HOME/.cache/vimfiles/.cache/
```
